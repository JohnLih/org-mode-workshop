* Org-mode Workshop

In November 2012, I was lucky enough to be able to conduct a workshop
about [[http://orgmode.org][Emacs Org-mode]] at [[http://www.TUGraz.at][Graz University of Technology]], Austria.

This repository contains all relevant material I collected and created
for this and possible future workshops on this great topic.

I would like to thank all contributors to Org-mode for this wonderful
"virtual box of Lego-bricks": Org-mode lets me build a huge variety of
great solutions, so that I've got the feeling, that I only start to
see the beginning!
